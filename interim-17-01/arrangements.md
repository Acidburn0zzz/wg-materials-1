### Meeting Location

[Akamai](https://akamai.com/) is hosting our meeting at their
offices in Tokyo, Japan ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/8cs81Mp1yJx)).

    Akamai Technologies Tokyo Office
    6F, Kyobashi Trust Tower

### Transportation

Tokyo is served by two major airports.

[NRT](http://www.narita-airport.jp/en/) is Narita International Airport. The quickest, easiest way
to get from Narita to the meeting location is to take the [Narita
Express](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/nex/) train, a one-hour trip that costs approximately Â¥2,800.

[HND](http://www.haneda-airport.jp/inter/en/) is Haneda International Airport, which is much closer
to Tokyo, but not quite as many International flights. There are a variety of ways to get from
Haneda to the meeting location, but the most direct is to take the [Keikyu-Kuko
Line](http://www.haneda-tokyo-access.com/en/) (which changes into the Asakusa Line) to Takaracho
Station, about a 35 minute train ride.

Upon arrival, it's advisable to get a [Suica](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/suica.html) or
[Pasmo](http://www.pasmo.co.jp/en/) IC card to pay for public transportation, as well as use in
convenience stores and vending machines.

The closest stations to the venue are Kyobashi (Ginza Line), Takaracho (Asakusa Line), and Tokyo Station (too many to list).
